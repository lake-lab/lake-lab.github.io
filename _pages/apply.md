### __Join us__

Interested in joining our lab at Princeton University? Wonderful!

Rather than emailing Brenden directly, __please express your interest through the links below__. Brenden will review all submissions by the 1st of every month (except for Ph.D. candidates -- your form registers your interest and helps me  bookmark your future PhD application). If you don't hear back by the 5th of the month, feel free to follow up at brenden@princeton.edu.

##### __Postdoc candidates__
We consider postdoc candidates on a case-by-case basis. Please express your interest through this [web form for postdoc candidates](https://forms.gle/zM2i4Q7uNijDfZqX9). Note, this is not a formal application and one must be invited to interview after submitting the form.

##### __Ph.D. candidates__
I am accepting students for Fall 2026. Interested Ph.D. candidates are encouraged to apply to either the 
[Ph.D. Program in Computer Science](https://gradschool.princeton.edu/academics/degrees-requirements/fields-study/computer-science#Apply)
or the [Ph.D. Program in Psychology](https://psychology.princeton.edu/graduate-program/applying).

Please submit this [web form for Ph.D. candidates](https://forms.gle/AXoau6Q7xuZnhUeaA) so I can learn a bit about you ahead of the formal application process, and so I can remember to look up your application later. You won't receive an email reply but I appreciate your submission.
