##### __About the lab__
In 2017, [Brenden Lake](https://cims.nyu.edu/~brenden/) started the Human & Machine Learning Lab at New York University in 2017. In 2025, the lab moved to Princeton University and evolved into the lab for Human & Machine Intelligence. We are joint between the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/) and the [Department of Psychology](https://psychology.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University. Our main location is in Princeton's [Peretsman Scully Hall](https://psychology.princeton.edu/contact) and includes rooms 117, 120, and 121.
